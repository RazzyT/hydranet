# Introduction

Since the early 1990’s, the Internet as a platform has been the first choice of those who want the ability to access information, store data, and share ideas and opinions. When the Internet was first developed, the idea was to build fault-tolerant communications between computer networks on a global scale. However, as these networks have grown ever larger, it has become more centralized; the capital and expertise required to maintain and expand these networks as they are today has surpassed the the abilities of the average person.

As a result, access to the Internet is now part of the leverage that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have over consumers. As if that wasn’t bad enough, governments now are able to monitor citizens and collect data about them without effort. With consumer protection regulations under constant threat by lobbyists, and the prospect of “Big Brother” watching the activities of Internet users, a new type of Internet is poised to take the scene: one that is truly decentralized, inherently secure, and owned by those who use it.

# The current problems facing the Internet

To the average user in the United States, the most glaring of the problems that are currently plaguing the Internet is the threat against Net Neutrality. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit organization devoted to protecting digital rights, defines Net Neutrality as “the idea that Internet service providers should treat all data that travels over their networks fairly, without improper discrimination in favor of particular apps, sites or services.” 

If Net Neutrality protection laws were overturned, it would allow for such things as Internet ‘fast lanes,’ and premium charges for certain websites and content, not unlike cable television packages. This would be a disaster for content creators who may be unfortunate enough to have their platform sold “for just a extra fee of $X per month!” It has the potential to nickle-and-dime businesses and corporations into paying extra charges so that their traffic won’t be throttled. In addition, It would hurt the consumers by hindering access to the content and information that they want to access.

The classified documents that NSA analyst Edward Snowden released in 2013 exposed one of the greatest invasions of personal privacy in the history of the United States. The first surveillance program that was unmasked was PRISM, which allowed court-approved access to the Google and Yahoo accounts of any American citizen. It also came to light that records of phone calls and other kinds of communication were being recorded, stored, and analyzed.

The information transfer protocols that the Internet runs on, TCP and IPv4, do not have security features built into it, like encryption and inherent anonymity. Not only does this open up vectors for government spying, but it also allows malicious civilian agents like hackers to steal sensitive personal data, install malware, and otherwise perform unwanted actions against a user’s network. The threat of ISPs subverting the Internet into a cash machine, constant surveillance by governments, and hackers stealing information, it becomes apparent that there is a need for a new way to transfer information.

# A solution: creating a peer-to-peer, community owned Internet

Enter Mesh Networking: the concept that individual devices on the same network (referred to as “Nodes”) can communicate with each other, and route data through each other. This creates a non-hierarchical, fault-tolerant network that is easy to join. These nodes don’t necessarily have to be specialized equipment: it can be a PC, or even a home/office router. Becoming a part of this network would be easy, because the software required is not difficult to set up. It would most likely be inexpensive as well, because the hardware needed to join a mesh network is usually not expensive, and some people already own the necessary electronics.

The only expenses that can be expected are from the installation of the infrastructure, like radios, antennas, and wired connections for high-bandwidth applications. Because this network is owned and operated by the people who use it, access to this network would be free. There would be no monthly charges. Anyone who tried to sell access to their node could be easily circumvented by simply connecting to a different node.


# Advantages of a decentralized network

The HydraNet project will be using a mesh networking protocol called CJDNS. CJDNS is a encrypted IPv6-based network. It provides security by default, as the encryption is built into the CJDNS protocol. It generates IPv6 addresses based on public-key cryptography instead of the traditional DHCP, which is address allocation from a pool of available addresses. Because of the unique way that addresses are created in CJDNS, there is a very small chance of address collision. In the same way that torrents use Distributed Hash Tables to store information about peers, CJDNS uses this method to calculate routing pathways. Because of the unique addresses and distributed routing tables, this leads to very efficient scaling of the network up to very large sizes.

As put well by the journal New Scientist, "Instead of letting other computers connect to you through a shared IP address which anyone can use, CJDNS only lets computers talk to one [another] after they have verified each other cryptographically. That means there is no way anyone can be intercepting your traffic." This is a huge technical asset for those who are concerned about privacy.

Given the mass presence of connected devices, a mesh network would make access to the network ubiquitous; you wouldn’t have to go to a specific place with a Wi-Fi hotspot like a coffee shop or a library to have access to the Internet, it would simply be everywhere within range of any mesh node. When a mesh network gains more members, it grows its area of availability, which allows access to more people, which increases availability even more, ad infinitum.

Distributed mesh nodes that interconnect with each other and are all capable of routing traffic make a network that is resilient to censorship. A network node can be shut down, but because of mesh networking’s nature of connecting to multiple peers, the downed node would not affect those who had access to another node. Censorious regimes would be ill-equipped to shut down all communications between those in a mesh network because it would require the shutdown of every single node on the network.


# Challenges of implementation

The first and most difficult hurdle of any mesh networking project is finding other people who are willing to join the project. In most areas, the first contributers to the network are people who are a fair distance from each other. Due to this, there needs to be more initial capital that has to be invested into towers and antennas. Some other problems are not always technical; convincing friends and neighbors to join a mesh network when they may not even know that much about networking is a good example of some of the social roadblocks that this project may face.

# Conclusion

The Internet as we use it now is centralized, and subject to control by governments and those who provide access to it. It is not inherently secure, and users have little control over its structure. This project has the ability to change all of that. It is no small task to overhaul the world’s largest network, but it all starts with us; "Think Globally, Act Locally." Slowly but surely however, as mesh networks start to spread, they can all connect to each other directly and gradually eliminate their dependance on ISPs to access information.
